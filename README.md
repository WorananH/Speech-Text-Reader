# Speech Text Reader

A text-to-speech app for non-verbal individuals. This project utilizes the Web Speech API to provide speech synthesis functionality.

## Project Description

This project aims to create a user-friendly text-to-speech application that can assist non-verbal individuals in communicating their needs, feelings, and thoughts. The app features pre-made buttons with common phrases and a custom text input for personalized messages. Users can select different voices and accents to suit their preferences.

## Project Specifications

- Create a responsive UI using CSS Grid to ensure optimal display on various devices.
- Implement button functionality to speak the associated text when clicked.
- Include a dropdown menu for selecting custom text to be spoken.
- Enable speech synthesis for the text entered in the custom text input.
- Provide options to change voices and accents for a more personalized experience.

## Motivation

This project holds personal significance as it was inspired by the developer's non-verbal autistic son. The app aims to replicate the functionality of an existing iPad app that the son uses for communication. By leveraging the Web Speech API, this project offers a simplified version of the original app, allowing non-verbal individuals to express themselves effectively.
